# Churn-Prediction
Customer churn is a significant challenge in various industries. Monitoring and analyzing customer departures and identifying loyal ones are crucial. Understanding the reasons behind churn helps optimize services and boost profitability, ensuring long-term business success.
The company's goal is to create a predictive model for churn prediction, allowing it to proactively identify at-risk customers and take measures to retain them. Before building the model, they conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided customer data to understand customer behavior, preferences, and attributes. This EDA is crucial for gaining valuable insights into factors influencing churn and informing decision-making.

Churn in business operations can be categorized into two types: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary churn occurs when customers consciously decide to discontinue their subscription or service usage, while involuntary churn results from external factors like payment failures. High churn rates can negatively impact a company's bottom line and reflect its overall perception among customers, affecting long-term growth.

The execution phase involves data quality checks, handling missing values, and data pre-processing. EDA is the next step, focusing on data distribution, relationships between variables, outliers, and correlations. Data pre-processing includes addressing missing values, converting variables to appropriate data types, and resolving data quality issues uncovered during EDA. Visualization through graphs and charts aids in understanding customer behavior and trends.

The analysis of numeric features within the dataset reveals insights into factors influencing churn. Longer customer tenure, shorter warehouse-to-home distances, more time spent on the app, multiple registered devices, higher satisfaction scores, the use of coupons, and higher order counts are associated with reduced churn. This analysis provides actionable insights for developing customer-centric strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) further uncovers insights related to gender, marital status, city tier, satisfaction scores, address density, complaints, device preferences, warehouse locations, product categories, cashback, and churn. These insights guide the company in tailoring strategies to reduce churn, such as targeting male customers, addressing singles' needs, and evaluating the mobile app experience.

In conclusion, the data-driven insights obtained from the EDA provide the foundation for implementing targeted strategies to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction. Recommendations include targeting specific customer segments, adjusting pricing strategies, and focusing on high-value customers. By understanding customer behavior and adapting strategies accordingly, the company can improve customer retention efforts and overall business performance, fostering lasting customer relationships and strengthening its competitive position.
